# Solutions to *Eloquent JavaScript* Exercises

This repository contains my personal solutions to the exercises from the book **_Eloquent JavaScript_** (3rd edition), written by **Marijn Haverbeke**.

The goal of this project is to practice JavaScript in a structured way by solving the challenges presented at the end of each chapter in the book.
